First bit of coding I have ever done with the steam API, free release for everyone.

****AS WITH ALL OPEN SOURCE CODE LOOK THROUGH IT FOR BACK DOORS AND OTHER THINGS!!!!!****

Programs you need to run the bot

Nodejs https://nodejs.org/en/

1. Use your cmd (search cmd in your windows search)

2. Launch the command version with nodejs

3. Download the the bot.js script

4. In cmd use the command cd, for example, my bots are located on C:\bots so I would type cd \bot

5. Type in these comnmands

6. npm install steam-user

7. npm install steam-totp

8. npm install steamcommunity

9. npm install steam-tradeoffer-manager

10. Open bot.js with your favorite text editor (Notepad ++ is good for noobs)

11. Edit the username and password

12. Get the shared_secret and identity_secret from your phone (http://forums.backpack.tf/index.php?/topic/45995-guide-how-to-get-your-shared-secret-from-ios-device-steam-mobile/)

13. Put them in the respective places.

14. And once you are done type in this command:

15. node bot.js

This will start the bot.
